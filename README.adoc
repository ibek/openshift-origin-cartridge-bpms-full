bpmPaaS Cartridge using BPMS6
==============================

== Overview

* Provides an Openshift Enterprise (OSE) cartridge with full suite of Red Hat BPMS6 functionality.  
* A view of the deployment architecture of a gear using this cartridge can be found [here.](https://raw.github.com/jboss-gpe-ose/openshift-origin-cartridge-bpms-full/master/doc/images/bpmPaaS-standalone-deployment-architecture.png)
* NOTE: this cartridge differs from the series of OSE *base* and *add-on* BPMS 6 cartridges.
  Those cartridges allow for more flexible bpmPaaS deployment architectures as per [this diagram.](https://raw.github.com/jbride/openshift-origin-cartridge-bpms-base/master/doc/bpmPaaS_Overview/images/bpms6-deployment-architecture-openshift.png)
* This cartridge is essentially a fork of the OSE jbosseap cartridge.
  Subsequently, most of administration guidelines documented in the jbosseap cartridge apply to this cartridge.
