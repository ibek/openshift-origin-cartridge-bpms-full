==============================

* A view of the deployment architecture of a gear using this cartridge can be found {cartdeploy}
* NOTE: this cartridge differs from the series of OSE *base* and *add-on* BPM Suite 6 cartridges.
  Those cartridges allow for more flexible bpmPaaS deployment architectures as per {flexcart}
* This cartridge is essentially a fork of the OSE jbosseap cartridge.
  Subsequently, most of administration guidelines documented in the jbosseap cartridge apply to this cartridge.
